ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies Used

The development of the AI-powered Travel Planner Agent leveraged a powerful combination of AI models, cloud infrastructure, and natural language processing tools provided by IBM. Below is a detailed breakdown of the tools and technologies used:


---

1. IBM Cloud Lite Services

A free-tier offering from IBM that allows developers to build, test, and deploy applications on the cloud. It provided access to AI services, storage, and serverless computing during the internship.


---

2. IBM Watsonx AI Studio

A collaborative environment for building, training, and evaluating machine learning and foundation models. It enabled the creation of customized AI workflows using:

Prompt engineering

Dataset integration

Model testing with ease


Role in the project:
Used to design and test the Travel Planner Agentâ€™s prompts and AI behaviors.


---

3. IBM Watsonx AI Runtime

The runtime environment responsible for deploying and scaling AI models efficiently on the IBM Cloud. It ensures smooth execution and scalability of the deployed travel agent application.

Role in the project:
Allowed real-time interaction with users, and executed responses from the trained AI agent.


---

4. IBM Cloud Agent Lab

A powerful tool for simulating and hosting AI-based virtual agents. It allows integration of AI models with dialog systems and user interface elements.

Role in the project:
Helped in building the user-agent interaction platform for travel-related queries and actions.
